1. What is amqp?
AMQP is an open, standardized way for applications to send and receive messages through a broker, such as RabbitMQ. This is so that producers and consumers donâ€™t have to worry about the delivery, routing, or retries. Utilizing AMQP ensures the data packets get where they need to go reliably.


2. What does it mean? guest:guest@localhost:5672 , what is the first guest, and what is the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for? 
The first guest is the username. The second guest is the password. localhost:5672 tells the client to connect to the broker running on our own machine (localhost) at port 5672, which is the default AMQP port.
